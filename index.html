<p> My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 123 because I learned a number of datatypes that surely will be very useful in many projects and applications that I will face in the future. </p>
<p> I can say that ARTS 1 is my favorite GE subject, because I learne how to truly appreciate art, look beyond the artwork itself, and dive into the deeper meanings and inspirations behind that specific artwork. </p>
<p> My favorite programming language so far is Java because there are a lot of easily accessible libaries and functionalities that allow the me to implement any functionality that I wish.</p>
<p> I firmly believe that my favorite food is hamburgers</p>

<h4> My hobbies are playing computer games, watching streams, biking around the campus either on the way to class, or during my free time, and of course eating. </h4>

<h4> My very first childhood dream was to become a pilot of a commercial airline. I dreamt of travelling around the world by flying there myself, and also making a living out of it in the process. <h4>
